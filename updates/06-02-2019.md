**Projekt:** Explain how NLP works at the example of news comments.

**Milestone in Arbeit:** Python library for count-based word embeddings.

**Letzte Woche:** I tried to port the existing codebase to Python 3. But it seems to be a lot of work so I only extract the parts I need and encapsulate them in a separate library. The existing code is also very inefficient and I have to re-write some parts. My computational resources are limited and I also want to reduce my power consumption. Good news: It looks like I finally have all the data I need. Besides, I ran some more experiments on parts of the data to get a better sense for the hyper-parameters.

**Diese Woche:** I focus fully on developing the library for now. In addition, I want to update the plan for the remaining time.

**Was bringt mich voran?** There are several annotated dataset for 'similarity' of German words I need. And also I am re-using low-level classes of the Python library GenSim.

**Was h√§lt mich zur√ºck?** I have some technical problems with my home setup. My network dropped irregularly. I suspect the router of my ISP is broken and I am getting it replaced. In addition, my server experienced random 'segfaults' I couldn't explain. Since I updated my BIOS they seem to be gone. üôè
