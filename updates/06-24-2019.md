**Projekt:** Explain how NLP works at the example of news comments.

**Milestone in Arbeit:** Python library for count-based word embeddings.

**Letzte Woche:**
Besides working on getting the library released, I did a benchmark on linear algebra libraries (MKL vs OpenBlas). The propierty library MKL is only slightly faster.

**Diese Woche:**
Finish the library, create a minimal documentation. Fully documenting it is out of scope for now but be done later on.

**Was bringt mich voran?**
I don't have any hardware or network problems anymore.

**Was hält mich zurück?**
It took me some tries to come up with a good abstraction.
