**Projekt:** Explain how NLP works at the example of news comments.

**Milestone in Arbeit:** Release Python library to clean text.

**Letzte Woche:** Literature review and first EDA (exploratory data analysis) of the data.

**Diese Woche:** Release a Python library to clean text. I was working for it for quite I while but never got it into a shape to release it to the wider public. Right now I am mostly working on improving the code quality and adding sufficient documentation. WIP: https://github.com/jfilter/clean-text, looking for feedback!

**Was bringt mich voran?** It's cool that there are some scientific papers about the topic that provide code. This allows me easily apply they method on my data. For papers without accompanying implemention, it seems complitly out of scope to re-implement it.

**Was hält mich zurück?** Required data cleaning and preprocessing.
