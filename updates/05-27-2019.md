**Projekt:** Explain how NLP works at the example of news comments.

**Milestone in Arbeit:** First Prototype

**Letzte Woche:** Releasing a Python package to lemmatize German texts: <https://github.com/jfilter/german-lemmatizer>. Since German is a highly inflective language, lemmatization is useful to reduce the number of distinct words. (e.g. "Ich war ein guter Sch체ler" => "Ich sein ein gut Sch체ler") This reduces the amount of required data and computation. I don't reinvent the wheel but use existing tools and create a simple Python wrapper around them.

**Diese Woche:** Porting some Open Source library for word embeddings from Python 2 to Python 3: <https://github.com/jfilter/hyperwords>. The package is from 2015 but a seminal paper was accompanying it. People still use it as of today for their research. I will (try to) port it to Python 3. Depending on the progress, I may also only extract the parts I need.

**Was bringt mich voran?** First promising results.

**Was h채lt mich zur체ck?** Long-running pre-processing steps punish every little bug.
