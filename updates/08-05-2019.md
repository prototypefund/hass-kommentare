**Projekt:** Explain how NLP works at the example of news comments.

**Milestone in Arbeit:** Final Video Animation

**Letzte Woche:**
I improved the quality by the embeddings in order to create visualizations. I split the data into bi-yearly chunks instead of yearly chunks. I also discovered that I was accidentally evaluate the quality of my (German) embeddings on an English test dataset. Thus I didn't use the correct hyperparameter. I fixed it now. I still have some experiments on a serer running but I will not focus on them for now.

Also the whole library is not the focus of my work anymore. I am now sure how to proceed with it. It could be worth submitting it to a scientific conference. I may get in contact with my former university.

**Diese Woche:**
First, I improve the animation to get a 'production ready'. Second, I will use [idyll](https://idyll-lang.org/) to create the basis of website to stich all the content together.

**Was bringt mich voran?**
Flora Power.

**Was hält mich zurück?**
I have a lot of different stuff to work on right now. It's not easy to focus on one thing. I got the feeling I have to push boundari. bla.
